## Interview Questions And Answers

### 1. How does computer science/programming give you what you need to continue learning?
In today's world, it is simply impossible to deny the vast impact that computers have had on society. At this point, computers are nearly vital for anyone that is trying to go anywhere professionally, as there are so many different benefits that come from using a computer. Whether that's using the extensive selection of options that Google offers for free (Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets), creating your own website or **so many** other options, it's quite easy to see the need for computers in the modern world. As well, computer science and computer programming rely on math and thus a wide variety of math skills can be learned from doing computer science, and vice versa. In addition, computer programming can easily be linked and used in the sciences, whether that's for simulating natural phenomena, or for assisting with medical work, like in hospitals! There are so many different concepts and ideas you can learn from engaging in computer science and computer programming.

In my personal experience, I've felt like I have certainly improved my overall skills when it comes to school, and, of course, most prominently in mathematics and computer science. Ever since I started to learn how to program, I have noticed that my overall understanding of math concepts has become much better and I've had a much easier time learning the concepts, and I think this is best attributed to the many lessons that you can take from doing computer programming and learning computer science. For example, constantly using documentation, no matter how tedious, has taught me to be more clear in any work that I'm doing, and make sure that I am showing and explaining all that I am doing. As well, through working with the natural simulations course on Khan Academy, I further developed by understanding of physics and was quite interested by the clear link between physics and computer science shown from that course. This is only scratching the surface of all that I've learned - and will continue to learn - from doing computer science and programming. I haven't even mentioned the great use of algorithms, functions that can directly translate into math and so much else. Simply put, computer science has helped me to develop skills that allow for me to be much more logical, effective and organized way when learning, and I am undoubtedly grateful for the impact that computer science has had on my life.
### 2. Summarize your experience with Khan Academy.
